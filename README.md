# Cardiovascular Diseases (CDVs) Detection with Deep Learning

## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 31% of all deaths worldwide. Among the many manifestations of CVDs, heart failure is a significant contributor, causing widespread mortality and reduced quality of life.

This project leverages a clinical dataset from Kaggle to develop a machine learning model that predicts patient survival after heart failure. By analyzing features such as age, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and comorbidities (e.g., anemia, diabetes), this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and improving treatment strategies.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data). It contains information on 299 patients with 12 clinical features, including:
- Demographics (e.g., age, sex)
- Laboratory findings (e.g., serum creatinine, serum sodium)
- Clinical history (e.g., presence of diabetes, high blood pressure)
- Outcome (survival status)

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
2. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
3. Provide insights into the most influential factors contributing to heart failure mortality.

## Why This Matters

With the growing prevalence of CVDs, early detection and proactive management are critical. By addressing this challenge with data-driven methods, this project contributes to the broader goal of reducing preventable deaths and enhancing patient care.
